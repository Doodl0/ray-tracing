# A basic ray-tracing implementation in Godot

![A render of the default scene](render.png "Render")

This project requires a GPU with compute shader support, and will not work with WebGL or the Godot compatability renderer.

Freecam is controlled like in the Godot editor - Hold right click to activate and use WASD or the arrow keys to move arround. Scroll wheel can be used to speed up or slow down.
